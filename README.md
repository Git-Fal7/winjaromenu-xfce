A fork of ZorinMenuLite with changes to make it something more to my personal preferences.

## About

A menu formatted similarly to Windows Vista and Windows 7 with some minor changes.
The menu features categories, places links, shortcuts, and a search bar.

## Keyboard shortcut
This menu is developed with Manjaro linux in mind, which has built in mapping of super to Alt+F1.
Command: `xfce4-popup-zorinmenulite`
Sortcut: Alt+F1
If necessary you may want to install ksuperkey or similar on your distribution.

## Window manager tweaks
Due to the nature of many window managers, you may need to add the menu to a list of ignored applications for keyboard input prevention, or focus prevention.
For compiz, go to CCSM > 'General Settings' -> 'Focus Prevention', and add "Zorin Menu Lite".
In KWin, go to KDE System Settings > Window Management > Window Rules
